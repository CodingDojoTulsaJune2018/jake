      <br>
      <p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. JavaScript is extremely popular for a variety of reasons. It is a small and lightweight language allowing 
      maximum flexibility for developers to take it in a bunch of different dirrectrions. JavaScript lives inside a host environment (a web browser or Node server), it can be connected to the objects of these environments to
      provide programmatic control over them.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Variable Declaration JavaScript variables are containers for storing data values - imagine a cup you fill with coffee, the cup holds the coffee, a variable holds a value. All JavaScript variables must be identified
            with unique names. These Unique names are called identifiers. var x;</li>
  
        <li>Variable Assignment Assignment operators assign values to JavaScript variables - our cup can now have coffee poured in it, giving our variable  value to hold. The = assignment operator assigns a value to
            a variable. var x = 10;</li>
  
        <li>Data Types Data types are an important concept; to be able to operate on variables you need to know the data type. There are six data types that are JavaScript primitives: Boolean - true or false;
            null - null aka nothing; Number - 42 or 3.14159; String - "Coding Dojo Rocks!"; Array - [1, 'Coding', 2, 'Dojo']; and Object - {first_name: 'Jane', last_name: 'Doe'}</li>
  
        <li>Conditionals When you write code, you want to perform different actions for different decisions - hitting different code blocks based on walues or conditions that have been met. You can use conditional statements
            in your code to accomplish this. There are the following conditional statements: if a specified condition is true, do this code in our code block; else if to specify a new condition to test, if the first condition is 
            false; else we execute this block of code;</li>
          
        <li>Loops There are many different kinds of loops in every programming language, but they all essentially do the same thing: they will repeat an action some number of times. Imagine you have to run a mile, 
            well you run around the track four times and then you stop. Thats a loop!</li>
  
        <li>Function Functions are an encaspulation of a code block. When we call our function this will run the code block. This of it as a list of instructions. As an example imagine we are putting together a desk 
            from Ikea, we open up the instruction manual and get started, first we screw the legs to the table top; next we place the table the right way up. Done! We finished our instructions. Sadly there are a ton more 
            tables to do so lets call our function over and over and over again.</li>
